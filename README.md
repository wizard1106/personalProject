This project was created by Mr. Chad Birger, Instructor of Data Analytics at the University of South Dakota; 
Mr. Zachary Tschetter, Instructor of Computer Science at the University of South Dakota;
and Paul Adam, a senior Computer Science major, Business Analytics minor, and the University of South Dakota.

The purpose of this project is to collect, store, and analyze a wide spectrum of Men's NCAA Basketball data from the 2023-2024
season and beyond. 

ISSUES TO ADDRESS
1. The python program times out after collecting a few days worth of game statistics.
    We need to figure out a way to collect all the game information from the 2023-24 season

2. Setting up a Cron Job in Azure to run the python program at 6:00 AM of the day  
   after games are played

3. Configure the Azure Database so I dont have to keep adding peoples IP address
    as Firewall rules and anyone can have read access

4. Better organize the game data so queries in SQL are easier to execute and find
    patterns

5. Try to find some correlation for whos refereeing the games and wheater the game
    has a better chance of hitting the over or the under for betting odds

6. Create a web page and/or a mobile app to render the tabels in an organized manner

7. Incorporate a sports book API to provide live odds and picks that our data says have
    a good chance of hitting
